<p style="font-size:16px">AJIO, a fashion and lifestyle brand, is Reliance Retail's digital commerce initiative and is the ultimate fashion destination for styles that are handpicked, on trend and at prices that are the best you'll find anywhere.
<p>We tried to clone the Ajio website from the scratch. For this, We have used the HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.And also we have added some Javascript libraries like Express,ejs,Mongooes etc.</p>
<p>We have connected our front-end part of our project to back-end databases like mongoDB atlas, mongoDB cluster. Our whole project is running on mongoDB server.</p>
<h2>Appendix</h2>
<p style="font-size:16px">We also implemented some functionalities like image Carousel, Forms, Drop-down etc.
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p style="font-size:16px">For using this code in your own system, firstly you have to clone this file into your local system. After that open it with any text Editor. There are seperate folders for CSS style, Data,comp for javascript functionalities, resource folder for Image etc. Our main Page(landing page) of this website is named as index.html. So, to view the project website on browser you have to run that landing page.

 Make sure that you open the whole Ajio project folder from text editor(eg. - VS Code). From the navbar of landing page, there are many more pages on which you can go. The pages are- Men,Women,Kids,Indie,Home & Kitchen,signin,Closet,Bag etc. Every page, images are rendering from back-end server</p>
